# TreEAID
TreEAID is an open-source tool for automated detection and analysis of tornado-induced treefall and root balls from high-resolution imagery. It uses deep learning, shape-aware refinement, and geospatial processing to produce treefall orientations, geometric features, and wind-field insights.
